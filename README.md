# 📧 WebSockets Chat Application

## 🚀 Getting Started

For this application you need a set of tools. NodeJS allows you to run JavaScript code on the server.
So we don't need to learn two different languages for front- and back-end.

### 💻 Setup

1. Download [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) and install it. Volta helps us to manage multiple versions of NodeJS at the same time, and let's us switch between them on a project basis.
2. If you're working on a windows machine, make sure to enable [Developer-Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers).
3. Use `volta install node@latest` to install the latest version of NodeJS. This automatically installs `npm`, a package manager for NodeJS.

### 🏃 Run

To run this application, open your terminal with the path of your this project and execute:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

If done correctly, you should see a message in the terminal that says:

`Listening on: http://localhost:8080`

After that, open up a browser-instance and navigate to <http://localhost:8080>.
